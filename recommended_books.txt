Covering ground in computer science, literature, philosophy, psychology, psychotherapy and sociology, this set is a fascinating insight into the development of ideas surrounding AI.

Clustering can be used as an independent data mining task to discern intrinsic characteristics of data, or as a preprocessing step with the clustering results then used for classification, correlation analysis, or anomaly detection. Kogan and his co-editors have put together recent advances in clustering large and high-dimension data. Their volume addresses new topics and methods which are central to modern data analysis, with particular emphasis on linear algebra tools, opimization methods and statistical techniques. The contributions, written by leading researchers from both academia and industry, cover theoretical basics as well as application and evaluation of algorithms, and thus provide an excellent state-of-the-art overview. The level of detail, the breadth of coverage, and the comprehensive bibliography make this book a perfect fit for researchers and graduate students in data mining and in many other important related application areas.

The application of graphs in clustering and visualization has several advantages. A graph of important edges (where edges characterize relations and weights represent similarities or distances) provides a compact representation of the entire complex data set. This text describes clustering and visualization methods that are able to utilize information hidden in these graphs, based on the synergistic combination of clustering, graph-theory, neural networks, data visualization, dimensionality reduction, fuzzy methods, and topology learning. The work contains numerous examples to aid in the understanding and implementation of the proposed algorithms, supported by a MATLAB toolbox available at an associated website.

It also includes a brief summary of two papers from invited speakers. The Catalan Association for Artificial Intelligence was founded in 1994 with the aim of fostering cooperation among researchers from the Catalan-speaking AI research community. Collaboration between ACIA members and the wider international AI community has also been well-established now for many years. The papers in these proceedings reflect this collaboration and include contributions not only from the Catalan-speaking regions of Spain, but also from France and Italy, and from as far afield as Mexico and Australia. Of all the computer sciences, AI is the one most intertwined with all sorts of disciplines dealt with in the human experience, often employing lessons learnt in one discipline to implement a task in another. The papers in this volume reflect the rich diversity inside AI, covering areas such as logics, natural language, machine learning, computer vision, robotics and multi-agent systems."--BOOK JACKET.

"Real progress in communication was made between theorists and practitioners in the evolutionary computation field. Speakers presented applications across a wide range of problem areas. In some of those cases, theoretically motivated methods worked quite well. In other cases, practitioners used domain-based methods to obtain better performance than could be achieved by using a "pure" evolutionary algorithm.  Individuals on both sides went away with a better appreciation of the successes and failures of current theory."--BOOK JACKET.

The book describes techniques for analysing data comprising measurements made on individuals or objects.. The techniques are used to make a prediction such as disease of a patient, the type of object illuminated by a radar, economic forecast. Emphasis is placed on techniques for classification, a term used for predicting the class or group an object belongs to (based on a set of exemplars) and for methods that seek to discover natural groupings in a data set. Each section concludes with a description of the wide range of practical applications that have been addressed and the further developments of theoretical techniques and includes a variety of exercises, from 'open-book' questions to more lengthy projects. New material is presented, including the analysis of complex networks and basic techniques for analysing the properties of datasets and also introduces readers to the use of variational methods for Bayesian density estimation and looks at new applications in biometrics and security.

Its theory and many applications form one of the major approaches to the contemporary artificial neural networks field, and new technolgies have already been based on it. The most important practical applications are in exploratory data analysis, pattern recognition, speech analysis, robotics, industrial and medical diagnostics, instrumentation, and control, and literally hundreds of other tasks. In this monograph the mathematical preliminaries, background, basic ideas, and implications are expounded in a clear, well-organized form, accessible without prior expert knowledge. Still the contents are handled with theoretical rigor.

The lines that draw the boundaries among statistics, optimization, arti cial intelligence and information processing are disappearing, and it is not uncommon to nd well-founded and sophisticated mathematical approaches in application - mains traditionally associated with ad-hoc programming. Heuristics has - come a branch of optimization and statistics. Clustering is applied to analyze soft data and to provide fast indexing in the World Wide Web. Non-trivial matrix algebra is at the heart of the last advances in computer vision. The breakthrough impulse was, apparently, due to the rise of the interest in arti cial neural networks, after its rediscovery in the late 1980s. Disguised as ANN, numerical and statistical methods made an appearance in the - formation processing scene, and others followed. A key component in many intelligent computational processing is the search for an optimal value of some function. Sometimes, this function is not evident and it must be made explicit in order to formulate the problem as an optimization problem. The search - ten takes place in high-dimensional spaces that can be either discrete, or c- tinuous or mixed. The shape of the high-dimensional surface that corresponds to the optimized function is usually very complex. Evolutionary algorithms are increasingly being applied to information processing applications that require any kind of optimization.

Its theory and many applications form one of the major approaches to the contemporary artificial neural networks field, and new technolgies have already been based on it. The most important practical applications are in exploratory data analysis, pattern recognition, speech analysis, robotics, industrial and medical diagnostics, instrumentation, and control, and literally hundreds of other tasks. In this monograph the mathematical preliminaries, background, basic ideas, and implications are expounded in a clear, well-organized form, accessible without prior expert knowledge. Still the contents are handled with theoretical rigor.

How is AI shaping our understanding of ourselves and our societies? In this book Kate Crawford reveals how this planetary network is fueling a shift toward undemocratic governance and increased inequality. Drawing on more than a decade of research, award-winning science, and technology, Crawford reveals how AI is a technology of extraction: from the energy and minerals needed to build and sustain its infrastructure, to the exploited workers behind "automated" services, to the data AI collects from us.    Rather than taking a narrow focus on code and algorithms, Crawford offers us a political and a material perspective on what it takes to make artificial intelligence and where it goes wrong. While technical systems present a veneer of objectivity, they are always systems of power. This is an urgent account of what is at stake as technology companies use artificial intelligence to reshape the world.

Now very much in the public consciousness, AI research has fallen in and out of favour over the years. Routledge Library Editions: Artificial Intelligence (10 Volumes) brings together as one set, or individual volumes, a small interdisciplinary series of previously out-of-print titles, originally published between 1970 and 1994. Covering ground in computer science, literature, philosophy, psychology, psychotherapy and sociology, this set is a fascinating insight into the development of ideas surrounding AI.

35661         AI superpowers   Kai-Fu Lee  132854639X  9781328546395  The United States has long been the leader in Artificial Intelligence. But Dr. Kai-Fu Lee--one of the world's most respected experts on AI--reveals that China has caught up to the US at an astonishingly rapid pace. As Sino-American competition in AI heats up, Lee envisions China and the US forming a powerful duopoly in AI. He outlines the upheaval of traditional jobs, how the suddenly unemployed will find new ways of making their lives meaningful, and how the Chinese and American governments will have to cope with the changing economic landscape.    "Kai-Fu Lee--one of the world's most respected experts on AI and China--reveals that China has suddenly caught up to the United States at an astonishingly rapid and unexpected pace. In AI Superpowers, Kai-fu Lee argues powerfully that because of the unprecedented developments in artificial intelligence, dramatic changes will be happening much sooner than many of us have expected. Indeed, as the U.S.-China competition in AI begins to heat up, Lee urges America and China to both accept and embrace the great responsibilities that come with significant technological power. Most experts already say that AI will have a devastating impact on blue-collar jobs. But Lee predicts that Chinese and American AI will have a strong impact on white-collar jobs as well. Is universal basic income the solution? In Lee's opinion, probably not. But he provides a clear description of which jobs will be affected and how soon, which jobs can be enhanced with AI, and, most important, how we can provide solutions to some of the most profound changes in human history that are coming soon."--Dust jacket.

How did it begin and evolve to human intelligence? Does a high level of biological intelligence require a complex brain? Can man-made machines be truly intelligent? Is AI fundamentally different from human intelligence? Rapid expansion of AI applications has made these questions pressing. To better prepare for the future society and its technology, including how the use of AI will impact our lives, it is essential to understand the biological root and limits of human intelligence. After systematically reviewing biological and computational underpinnings of decision making and intelligent behaviors, this book proposes that true intelligence requires life"--

Now very much in the public consciousness, AI research has fallen in and out of favour over the years. Routledge Library Editions: Artificial Intelligence (10 Volumes) brings together as one set, or individual volumes, a small interdisciplinary series of previously out-of-print titles, originally published between 1970 and 1994. Covering ground in computer science, literature, philosophy, psychology, psychotherapy and sociology, this set is a fascinating insight into the development of ideas surrounding AI.

8446    Birth of Intelligence     Daeyeol Lee         NaN  9780190908324  "What is intelligence? How did it begin and evolve to human intelligence? Does a high level of biological intelligence require a complex brain? Can man-made machines be truly intelligent? Is AI fundamentally different from human intelligence? Rapid expansion of AI applications has made these questions pressing. To better prepare for the future society and its technology, including how the use of AI will impact our lives, it is essential to understand the biological root and limits of human intelligence. After systematically reviewing biological and computational underpinnings of decision making and intelligent behaviors, this book proposes that true intelligence requires life"--

54517  The artificial intelligence revolution  Louis Anthony Del Monte  0988171821  9780988171824  The Artificial Intelligence Revolution by Louis A. Del Monte is a warning regarding the threat new artificial intelligence (AI) technology poses to the survival of humankind. Will the future come down to man versus machine, when machines become more intelligent than humans? Will an artificial intelligence robot be your friend or foe?  Scientists are working relentlessly at improving AI technology for the benefit of man. Evolved technology is everywhere--smart TVs, smart phones, and even smart houses. One day the artificial intelligence of these machines will match our own intelligence--and one day it will exceed it. We will have reached the "singularity," a point in time like no other.  Then what?  Will machines continue to serve us as the balance tips in their favor? These questions are addressed rigorously, their potentialities extrapolated for one reason--the survival of humankind.  Are "strong" AI machines (SAMs) a new form of life?  Should SAMs have rights?  Do SAMs pose a threat to humankind?  Del Monte and other AI experts predict that AI capabilities will develop into SAMs with abilities far beyond what human beings can even fathom. Will they serve us, or will SAMs take an entirely different viewpoint? That question and many more are tackled by Del Monte in this sobering look at the The Artificial Intelligence Revolution. -- Provided by publisher.

Now very much in the public consciousness, AI research has fallen in and out of favour over the years. Routledge Library Editions: Artificial Intelligence (10 Volumes) brings together as one set, or individual volumes, a small interdisciplinary series of previously out-of-print titles, originally published between 1970 and 1994. Covering ground in computer science, literature, philosophy, psychology, psychotherapy and sociology, this set is a fascinating insight into the development of ideas surrounding AI.

If we get it right it will make humans almost godlike. If we get it wrong... well, extinction is not the worst possible outcome. Surviving AI is a concise, easy-to-read guide to what's coming, taking you through technological unemployment (the economic singularity) and the possible creation of a superintelligence (the technological singularity).

How is AI shaping our understanding of ourselves and our societies? In this book Kate Crawford reveals how this planetary network is fueling a shift toward undemocratic governance and increased inequality. Drawing on more than a decade of research, award-winning science, and technology, Crawford reveals how AI is a technology of extraction: from the energy and minerals needed to build and sustain its infrastructure, to the exploited workers behind "automated" services, to the data AI collects from us.    Rather than taking a narrow focus on code and algorithms, Crawford offers us a political and a material perspective on what it takes to make artificial intelligence and where it goes wrong. While technical systems present a veneer of objectivity, they are always systems of power. This is an urgent account of what is at stake as technology companies use artificial intelligence to reshape the world.
64056  Beyond Artificial Intelligence  Jozef Kelemen         NaN  9783642344220  <p>Products of modern artificial intelligence (AI) have mostly been formed by the views, opinions and goals of the “insiders”, i.e. people usually with engineering background who are driven by the force that can be metaphorically described as the pursuit of the craft of Hephaestus. However, since the present-day technology allows for tighter and tighter mergence of the “natural” everyday human life with machines of immense complexity, the responsible reaction of the scientific community should be based on cautious reflection of what really lies beyond AI, i.e. on the frontiers where the tumultuous ever-growing and ever-changing cloud of AI touches the rest of the world.</p><p> </p><p>The chapters of this boo are based on the selected subset of the presentations that were delivered by their respective authors at the conference “Beyond AI: Interdisciplinary Aspects of Artificial Intelligence” held in Pilsen in December 2011.</p><p> </p><p>From its very definition, the reflection of the phenomena that lie beyond AI must be inherently interdisciplinary. And so is this book: all the authors took part in a mutual transdisciplinary dialogue after explaining their views on AI not only to a narrow selection of their usual close peers with the same specialisation, but to a much broader audience of various experts from AI engineering, natural sciences, humanities and philosophy. The chapters of this book thus reflect results of such a dialogue.</p><p> </p>

La Raja                    NaN  9780415535540,9780415535571,9780203112403  "New Directions in American Politics brings together top scholars to write original essays across the standard curriculum of American government and politics, capturing emerging research in the discipline in a way that is accessible for undergraduates. Each chapter combines substantive knowledge with the kind of skill-building and analytical inquiry that is being touted at top universities across the country. Contributors to New Directions highlight why the questions they seek to answer are critical for understanding American politics, and situate them in the broader context of controversies in research. The book will introduce students to how political science works, in addition to how our political system works. The teaching of American politics follows a well-worn path. Textbooks for introductory courses hew to a traditional set of chapters that describe the Founding, American institutions, the ways citizens participate in politics, and sometimes public policy. The material rarely engages students in the kind of questions that animate scholarship on politics. One hurdle for instructors is finding material that reflects quality scholarship--and thus teaches students about why, not just what--and yet is accessible for undergraduates. Articles in scholarly journals are typically unsuited for undergraduate courses, particularly introductory courses. What is needed is a book that conveys exciting trends in scholarship across vital topics in American politics and illustrates analytical thinking. New Directions in American Politics is that book and will be an ideal companion to standard textbooks that focus mostly on nuts and bolts of politics"--

3005    New directions in American politics  Raymond J.

Each chapter combines substantive knowledge with the kind of skill-building and analytical inquiry that is being touted at top universities across the country. Contributors to New Directions highlight why the questions they seek to answer are critical for understanding American politics, and situate them in the broader context of controversies in research. The book will introduce students to how political science works, in addition to how our political system works. The teaching of American politics follows a well-worn path. Textbooks for introductory courses hew to a traditional set of chapters that describe the Founding, American institutions, the ways citizens participate in politics, and sometimes public policy. The material rarely engages students in the kind of questions that animate scholarship on politics. One hurdle for instructors is finding material that reflects quality scholarship--and thus teaches students about why, not just what--and yet is accessible for undergraduates. Articles in scholarly journals are typically unsuited for undergraduate courses, particularly introductory courses. What is needed is a book that conveys exciting trends in scholarship across vital topics in American politics and illustrates analytical thinking. New Directions in American Politics is that book and will be an ideal companion to standard textbooks that focus mostly on nuts and bolts of politics"--

Now very much in the public consciousness, AI research has fallen in and out of favour over the years. Routledge Library Editions: Artificial Intelligence (10 Volumes) brings together as one set, or individual volumes, a small interdisciplinary series of previously out-of-print titles, originally published between 1970 and 1994. Covering ground in computer science, literature, philosophy, psychology, psychotherapy and sociology, this set is a fascinating insight into the development of ideas surrounding AI.

This leads to a dialog of truly interdisciplinary character. The book covers aspects of fuzzy logic, case based reasoning, learning as well as meaning, language, and consciousness. The authors of this topical volume have their background in logic, computer science, physics and mathematics, philosophy, psychology and neurobiology.

Today, AI is referenced in the news, books, movies, and TV shows, and the exact definition is often misinterpreted. Artificial Intelligence For Dummies provides a clear introduction to AI and how it́⁰₉s being used today. Inside, you'll get a clear overview of the technology, the common misconceptions surrounding it, and a fascinating look at its applications in everything from self-driving cars and drones to its contributions in the medical field. --

This volume was an attempt primarily to inform fellow AI workers of recent European work in AI. It was hoped that researchers in sister' disciplines, such as computer science and linguistics would gain a deeper understanding of the assumptions, techniques and tools of contemporary AI.

It also includes a brief summary of two papers from invited speakers. The Catalan Association for Artificial Intelligence was founded in 1994 with the aim of fostering cooperation among researchers from the Catalan-speaking AI research community. Collaboration between ACIA members and the wider international AI community has also been well-established now for many years. The papers in these proceedings reflect this collaboration and include contributions not only from the Catalan-speaking regions of Spain, but also from France and Italy, and from as far afield as Mexico and Australia. Of all the computer sciences, AI is the one most intertwined with all sorts of disciplines dealt with in the human experience, often employing lessons learnt in one discipline to implement a task in another. The papers in this volume reflect the rich diversity inside AI, covering areas such as logics, natural language, machine learning, computer vision, robotics and multi-agent systems."--BOOK JACKET.

An exciting new field has grown around the study of behavior-based intelligence, also known as embodied cognitive science, "new AI," and "behavior-based AI."".  "Rolf Pfeifer and Christian Scheier provide a systematic introduction to this new way of thinking about intelligence and computers. After discussing concepts and approaches such as subsumption architecture, Braitenberg vehicles, evolutionary robotics, artificial life, self-organization, and learning, the authors derive a set of principles and a coherent framework for the study of naturally and artificially intelligent systems, or autonomous agents.  This framework is based on a synthetic methodology whose goal is understanding by designing and building."--BOOK JACKET.

While the early interest in AI was mainly triggered by the desire to develop artifacts that show the same intelligent behavior as humans, nowadays scientists have realized that research in AI involves a multitude of separate challenges, besides the traditional goal to replicate human intelligence. In particular, recent history has pointed out that a variety of ‘intelligent’ computational techniques, part of which are inspired by human intelligence, may be successfully applied to solve all kinds of practical problems. This sub-area of AI, which has its main emphasis on applications of intelligent systems to solve real-life problems, is currently known under the term Applied Intelligence.   The objective of the International Conference on Industrial, Engineering & Other Applications of Applied Intelligent Systems (IEA/AIE) is to promote and disseminate recent research developments in Applied Intelligence. The current book contains 30 chapters authored by participants of the 26th edition of IEA/AIE, which was held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The material of each chapter is self-contained and was reviewed by at least two anonymous referees, to assure a high quality.

How did it begin and evolve to human intelligence? Does a high level of biological intelligence require a complex brain? Can man-made machines be truly intelligent? Is AI fundamentally different from human intelligence? Rapid expansion of AI applications has made these questions pressing. To better prepare for the future society and its technology, including how the use of AI will impact our lives, it is essential to understand the biological root and limits of human intelligence. After systematically reviewing biological and computational underpinnings of decision making and intelligent behaviors, this book proposes that true intelligence requires life"--

Taking a clear, non-technical approach, Donald Gillies focuses on two key topics within AI: machine learning in the Turing tradition and the development of logic programming and its connection with non-monotonic logic. Demonstrating how current views on scientific method are challenged by this recent research, he goes on to suggest a new framework for the study of logic. He draws on work by such seminal thinkers as Bacon, Godel, Popper, Penrose, and Lucas to address the hotly contested question of whether computers might become intellectually superior to human beings. These topics will attract a wide readership from followers of advances in artificial intelligence, to students and scholars of the history and philosophy of science"--Publisher's description.

Unlike the vast majority of philosophical critiques of AI, however, each of the authors in this volume has made a serious attempt to come to terms with the scientific theories that have been developed, rather than attacking superficial straw men which bear scant resemblance to the complex theories that have been developed. For each is convinced that the philosophers responsibility is to contribute from his own special intellectual point of view to the progress of such an important field, rather than sitting in lofty judgement dismissing the efforts of their scientific peers. The aim of this book is thus to correct some of the common misunderstandings of its subject. The technical term Artificial Intelligence has created considerable unnecessary confusion because of the ordinary meanings associated with it, and for that very reason, the term is endlessly misused and abused. The essays collected here all aim to expound the true nature of AI, and to remove the ill-conceived philosophical discussions which seek answers to the wrong questions in the wrong ways. Philosophical discussions and decisions about the proper use of AI need to be based on a proper understanding of the manner in which AI-scientists achieve their results; in particular, in their dependence on the initial planning input of human beings. The collection combines the Anglo-Saxon school of analytical philosophy with scientific and psychological methods of investigation. The distinguished authors in this volume represent a cross-section of philosophers, psychologists, and computer scientists from all over the world. The result is a fascinating study in the nature and future of AI, written in a style which is certain to appeal and inform laymen and specialists alike."--Provided by publisher.
